\title{\bf Exercise 5: An Auctioning Agent for the Pickup and Delivery Problem}
\author{Group \textnumero: Student 1, Student 2}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Bidding strategy}
% describe in details your bidding strategy. Also, focus on answering the following questions:
% - do you consider the probability distribution of the tasks in defining your strategy? How do you speculate about the future tasks that might be auctions?
% - how do you use the feedback from the previous auctions to derive information about the other competitors?
% - how do you combine all the information from the probability distribution of the tasks, the history and the planner to compute bids?

\section{Results}
% in this section, you describe several results from the experiments with your auctioning agent

\subsection{Experiment 1: Comparisons with dummy agents}
% in this experiment you observe how the results depends on the number of tasks auctioned. You compare with some dummy agents and potentially several versions of your agent (with different internal parameter values). 

\subsubsection{Setting}
% you describe how you perform the experiment, the environment and description of the agents you compare with

\subsubsection{Observations}
% you describe the experimental results and the conclusions you inferred from these results

\vdots

\subsection{Experiment n}
% other experiments you would like to present (for example, varying the internal parameter values)

\subsubsection{Setting}

\subsubsection{Observations}
